## Trygg
Trygg, safe in Swedish, is a tool to execute/evaluate policy rules in Rust.
It does so by executing an OPA Policy that has been compiled to wasm.
(Ignore the name, I just had to name it something).

The motivation for using OPA's ability to compile policies into wasm is that the
same wasm policy can be used with Rust, Node.js, (and other wasm runtimes), and
at the same wasm module can be used in a OPA server running somewhere as part of
a CI/CD pipeline, or in a Kubernetes gatekeeper.

### Install OPA
This step is only required if one wants to work with the OPA
[policies](./policies) and rebuild wasm modules.

```console
$ cd policies
$ curl -L -o opa https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/releases/download/v0.45.0/opa_linux_amd64
$ chmod 744 opa
```

### Polices
The [polices](./policies) directory contains the polices that are used as
examples, there is currently only one policy. This can tested and then built
into a wasm module using the following command:
```console
$ cd policies
$ make test
./opa test . -v
test-license.rego:
data.test_license.test_allow: PASS (391.199Âµs)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PASS: 1/1

$ make license.wasm 
./opa build -t wasm -e license/allow license.rego
```
The last command will produce a wasm module named `license.wasm` in the
policies directory.

### Running
After building the policy in the previous step we can evaluate the policy
against some [input](./examples/licenses-input.txt):
```console
$ cargo r -q -- --wasm=policies/license.wasm --entry-point=license/allow --input=examples/licenses-input.txt

Evaluating:
policy_name: None
input: [{"name":"MIT Licence"},{"name":"Apache-License 2.0"},{"name":"something"}]
data: {}

Result:
[{"result":true}]
```

This policy called above does not take any as data json file can be specified
using a command line option. 

```console
trygg is a tool to execute OPA policies wasm modules

Usage: trygg [OPTIONS] --wasm <WASM> --entry-point <ENTRY_POINT>

Options:
  -w, --wasm <WASM>                The policy as a wasm module
  -e, --entry-point <ENTRY_POINT>  The entry_point/rule to be executed
  -i, --input <INPUT>              The input file in json format (optional)
  -d, --data <DATA>                The data file in json format (optional)
  -p, --policy-name <POLICY_NAME>  The name of the policy to be run [default: None]
  -h, --help                       Print help information
  -V, --version                    Print version information
```

### cargo tools
As a developer checking the policies of dependencies might be run as a cargo
thrird party command, something like:
```console
$ cargo r -q --bin cargo-license-check -- --input=examples/licenses-input.txt
Evaluating:
policy_name: license-check
input: [{"name":"MIT Licence"},{"name":"Apache-License 2.0"},{"name":"something"}]
data: {}
Result:
[{"result":true}]
```

```console
$ cargo r -q --bin cargo-license-check -- --help
cargo-license-check is a tool that checks license of dependencies according to...

Usage: cargo-license-check [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -i, --input <INPUT>  The input file in json format (optional)
  -d, --data <DATA>    The data file in json format (optional)
  -h, --help           Print help information
  -V, --version        Print version information
```
This is not actually checking any dependencies (yet), but only evaluating the
policy. It is just to try out the idea.

### Goals/Questions

#### How to we avoid another left-pad?
In this case left-pad was removed from the npm repository. To avoid this we
would need to host this module somewhere which I thought was something we
wanted to avoid?

#### How can I ensure I'm using a RHT-supported stack?
In this case we are talking about software dependencies and that these are Red
Hat supported versions.

We could add `in-toto` to our dependencies and then create an OPA policy that
checks the ones a project uses. This policy would be runnable on the command
line and be able to integrate into the development workflow. 

But adding `in-toto` to projects is probably not a small task and I'm assuming
that there are many Red Hat projects which would require this. But if we can
create a [in-toto layout](https://in-toto.engineering.nyu.edu/)  which might
be general enough to be applicable to multiple projects, that might make it
easier?

#### How can I avoid mixing incompatible licenses?
Again, we could create another policy that checks this.
For Rust we can get the content of Cargo.toml as json and then input that into
our policy rule:
```console
$ cargo metadata --format-version=1
```
For Node.js package.json is already in json format and could be used as input
for a policy rule.

#### What about other non-supported dependencies?
It will/would be great if we use in-toto or something to verify that software
coming from Red Hat is secure. But a large number of dependencies in a project
will not come from Red Hat. Even if I as a user verify all of the Red Hat deps
I'm still vulnerable software supply-chain attacks from other dependencies.

Perhaps I'm being naive here, but could we start helping open source projects,
like the ones that are most used by our customers and help them setup in-toto
or something else. I understand that this would cost us money but it would help
our customers secure thier products and also might give a good amount of good
will from the community.
